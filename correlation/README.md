Computing the eigen values and vectors of a correlation matrix for a Karhunen Lo√®ve Expansion (KLE)
===============================
a Python wrapper for C++ using SWIG
===================================

Features of python/C++/SWIG demonstrated
------------------
* Numpy wrapping
* C++ classes
* openMP
* the simplest makefile ever
* compares 
  * an in memory sparse representation to 
  * a compute as you go method (faster here)
* tests with full python implementation
* KLE 

To use
------------------
```
make
python make_kle.py
```
You'll need to customize make_kle.py
